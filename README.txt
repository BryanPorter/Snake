Snake Project

CS 3430  Fall 2015

The is a remake of the classic snake game.

As this is the first game which I have created using PyGame, I used a game 
called 'Run' as a reference for understanding different PyGame functions.
This game can be found at www.pygame.org/project-Run!-2608-.html and
while I did not copy code directly, There are portions (such as the menu)
that are similar to the code used in this game.  When I felt that this was
the case, I did additional coding to demonstrate that I understand what
codes were being used and to make it apply more directly to my game.

The font used in the game is TIMOTHEOS and can be found on dafont.com

Sounds are from various Bomberman games, 
   found at http://downloads.khinsider.com/

All graphics were created using GIMP 2.8
